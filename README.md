# Minesweeper Game
## Using GUI ( Java Swing and Java.awt );

Created a minesweeper game with pre-determined[^1] values for the grid size and bomb count. Used java.swing and java.awt, with simple
concepts in OOP.


[^1]: I will implement the ability for the player to choose the size of the grids in later commits.
